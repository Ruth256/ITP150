# Started with 4-1 pizza.py
yummy_pizzas = ['cheese', 'bean', 'round', 'square', 'flimsy']
# first three
print("The first three items in the list are:")
for pizza in yummy_pizzas[0:3]: # or [:3]
    print(pizza.title())

# three from the middle
print("Three items from the middle of the list are:")
for pizza in yummy_pizzas[1:4]: #cheese placement is 0, bean is 1, round is 2, square is 3, and flimsy is 4. 1-3 are the three from the middle.
    print(pizza.title())

# Last three
print("The last three items in the list are:")
for pizza in yummy_pizzas[-3:]:
    print(pizza.title())
