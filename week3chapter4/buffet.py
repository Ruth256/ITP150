# 4-13: Buffet
# A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. Think of five simple foods, and store them in a tuple.
# Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers.
# Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the change.
# The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different foods. 
# Add a block of code that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for loop to print each of the items on the revised menu.

buffet_foods = ('brisket', 'lobster', 'pancakes', 'beans', 'worms')
for food in buffet_foods:
     print(food)
# attempt to modify buffet_foods[2]= 'gator'

buffet_foods = ('spam', 'lobster', 'poptart wrappers', 'beans', 'worms')
for food in buffet_foods:
     print(food)
# 'spam' and 'poptart wrappers' only redefined the tuple
